## Abstract of Article
Future wireless networks need to support massive machine type communication (mMTC) where a massive number of devices accesses the network and massive MIMO is a 
promising enabling technology. 
Massive access schemes have been studied for co-located massive MIMO arrays. 
In this paper, we investigate the activity detection in grant-free random access for mMTC in cell-free massive MIMO networks using distributed arrays. 
Each active device transmits a non-orthogonal pilot sequence to the access points (APs) and the APs send the received signals to a central processing unit 
(CPU) for joint activity detection. 
The maximum likelihood device activity detection problem is formulated and algorithms for activity detection in cell-free massive MIMO are provided to solve it. 
The simulation results show that the macro diversity gain provided by the cell-free architecture improves the activity detection performance compared to 
co-located architecture when the coverage area is large.
